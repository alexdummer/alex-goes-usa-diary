## Research
I continued working on the microstructure simulations. I found the limit of my desktop computer when trying to run a simulation with 160x160 unit cells.
The computer ran out of memory with 64 GB of RAM using the direct PARDISO solver in [EdelweissFE][edelweissfe]. I know that this is not the best option for such large models, and I will definitely try to use other options in the future.
To speed up computations, I built a Singularity container with EdelweissFE and and Marmot to be used on the Alpine cluster at CU Boulder. I also started to find out how the SLURM job scheduler works.
In summary, a productive day!

## Training
I went for a run in the morning. I am still feeling very slow. 
Hopefully, the training will pay off in the next couple of weeks.
