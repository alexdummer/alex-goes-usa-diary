## Research
I spent most of the day writing a new model generator in [EdelweissFE][edelweissfe] for my direct numerical simulations with discrete microstructure.
This simulations will be used as validation for my micropolar model.
The idea of this generator is that only one unit cell needs to be meshed with a software of choice and then the generator will create a periodic arrangement of these unit cells.
This is convinient becaus I can vary the size of the domain without the need to remesh everything.
I got a working prototype today which I will further improve in the next days.

## Training
Today I had an one hour indoor bike session in the evening.
It the middle of the session I did 6x1min at 250 watts with 1min rest.
I was super motivated and pushed myself hard during the intervals.
Hard to believe that 250 watt was approximately my FTP just a year ago!
The rest of the training I tried to hold 195 watts which was not possible 
for the last 15 minutes.
I have the feeling that my fitness increases, but it's a slow process.
