Last weekend on saturady I went for a 4 hour hike/run in the flatirons. 
I felt pretty slow but I did not think about it too much. On this day I also went to the football game of the university of Colorado Boulder. It was an exciting experience in the stadium and in the bars downtown. I met Oliver a visiting PostDoc form Switzerland there. He works with Sebastian in the aerospace department.
On Sunday I had a headache because of the last beer I drank the day before- it is always the last one that gets you ;)
Nevertheless, I went for lunch with Haden, Amir and Noah in a Vieetnamese restaurant. Afterwards I went to the gym and for a swim in the pool. 
Noah works at Sandia National Labs and used to be a PhD student at CU Boulder in the same office as I am now.
He is also working on micropolar materials and we had some nice discussions because he also was in the office from monday to wednesday this week.
We figured out that one photo on my phonbe was actually from his talk at USCCM 17 in Albuquerque in 2023 - the famous continuum potato.

I started the week working on my first paper draft. I did some simulations and worked on the theory sections. Thermodynamics of micropolar materials is quite challenging, or is it just me?
On Wednesday I had a meeting with my advisor to discuss the progress of my research. We also talked about the next steps and the conferences I could attend next year. I will definitely visit Caltech in June.

My health got worse during the week and on Wednesday I had to go home early because I got fever and chills. 
I stayed in bed until Friday and could not work at all. Being away from home when sick makes me miss my family even more.

On Saturday and Sunday I felt much better and went for a short walk around the neighborhood.
