## Day summary
Good monday today. Some progress in the office and a good training session on the bike in the evening.

## Research 
Today I focused on extending the classical Ogden model to the micropolar. 
This included lots of reading and thinking. I finally came up with a good formulation that also started to implement.
One challenge is to implement the calculation of the principal stretches 
by solving the Eigenvalue problem. I found Cardano's method to be a good approach here.
It is an elegant solution for cubic equations and it's variant with trigonometric functions 
is suited for real roots only. This is exactly what we need for the principal stretches.
This way I can use automatic differentiation to derive stress and tangent without worrying about
the derivatives of the Eigenvalues.

## Training
In the evening I went for a ride on the indoor trainer.
Surprisingly, I felt quite strong today.
Compared to the last session with 195 watt target power, 
I was able to hold it for the full 45 minutes today.
