## Day summary
After breakfast I went to the University approx. at 8am and came back at 6:30am.
I decided to test my baking skills and made the dough for french baguettes. 
It had to rest and I went for a run in the meantime.
The baguettes went in the oven for 25min and subsequently into my stomach. Not bad for the first time. 
I concluded the day with chilling on the couch,

## Research
A monday in the office. I wasn't really productive, but prepared myself for the weekly meeting with my host to discuss the progress. I should definitely start implemneting my model idea soon. I worked also on my paper on on concrete and on [Marmot][marmot] documentation

## Training
Started again with training in the evening. The warm up included 50 air squats, 12 push ups and 40 diegonal crunches. After that I went for a slow 30 minute run (4.74km). Felt really good, no problems with my knee. But I am not really fit this time. Hope this gets better soon.
