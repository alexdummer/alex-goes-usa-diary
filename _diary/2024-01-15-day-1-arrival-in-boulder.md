## 🌅 Morning

What an incredible start to this journey! I arrived in Boulder yesterday evening, and waking up to see the Flatirons covered in snow was absolutely breathtaking. The altitude definitely made itself known - I felt a bit winded just walking up the stairs to my apartment.

## 🔬 Research Update

No research activities today as I'm still getting settled. Tomorrow I'll be visiting the lab for the first time and meeting my research supervisor. I'm excited but also nervous about starting this new chapter.

## 🏃‍♂️ Training & Sports

Took it easy today due to jet lag and altitude adjustment. Just a gentle walk around the neighborhood to explore and get my bearings. Planning to start with some light jogging once I've acclimatized.

## 🎯 Daily Activities & Adventures

Spent most of the day setting up my apartment and exploring the Pearl Street Mall. The local coffee shops are amazing - grabbed a latte at Ozo Coffee and chatted with some friendly locals who gave me great tips about hiking trails. 

Went grocery shopping at Whole Foods - the selection of outdoor gear and healthy food options here is incredible. Everyone seems so active and outdoorsy!

## 🌙 Evening Reflection

I'm feeling a mix of excitement and homesickness. Boulder feels like it's going to be an amazing place to spend a year. The combination of academic opportunities and outdoor adventures is exactly what I was hoping for. Can't wait to start exploring the mountains properly.
