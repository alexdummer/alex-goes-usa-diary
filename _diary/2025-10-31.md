## Day summary
My wife and I started our day with a breakfast together. I made fresh baguettes, which turned out great. After breakfast, we packed up and headed to Rocky Mountain National Park for a day of hiking and sightseeing with our friends. The weather was cold and partially cloudy, but it didn't dampen our spirits. We explored several trails, took in the stunning views, and even spotted some wildlife.
On the way out we stopped at the Dark Horse and grabbed some burgers for dinner.
After that we spent the evenning playing the card game "Salem 1692" with our friends, which was a lot of fun. I am not really sure if anyone else is 
playing the game as passionated as we are. I am always exhausted after playing it.
