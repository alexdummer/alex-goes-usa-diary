## Day summary
Started my day with a trail run in the morning. Went to the University afterwards and 
felt pretty tired. 

## Research
Not a very productive day. 
I read more about micropolar continuum theories and started to set up 
a first numerical example, a simple torsion test of a cuboid, in [EdelweissFE][edelweissfe].
I struggled with reading out the reaction moments when using a rigid body constraint.
Due to feeling tired, I went home a little bit earlier than planned.

## Training
I made a 13km trail run in the morning. To stay in my training zones I had to walk uphill.
Felt pretty good, the fitness is coming back and my knee feels also good.
