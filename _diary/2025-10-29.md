## Reserach
Today I had two important meetings regarding my research project.
The first meeting was with my advisor to discuss the progress of research and next steps.
For this I prepared a short presentation summarizing my during the last week. 
We mainly discussed the priliminary results on the torsional relaxation test.
After that I met with Thomas, which I first met at the USNCCM conference in Albuquerque.
He introduced the research code called Tardigrade, whcih can be used for micromorphic simulations.

## Training
After work I went to the Recreation Center for the planned swim workout. I found out that the club swim team was having practice at the same time, so the pool was not available.
Instead, I decided to go for a trail run starting at home.
I did a 10 km run with 250 mters of ascent.
I have the feeling that my endurance is slowly coming back.
