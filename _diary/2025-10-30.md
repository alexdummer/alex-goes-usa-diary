## Day summary
I started my day off with some fresh baguettes which I baked my self in the morning.
After that I went to work, and did my swim workout shich was planned for yesterday in the evening.
Afterwards my wife and my friends arrived in Boulder from their road trip starting in Las Vegas and going through Utah.
I ordered some mexican food and we had a nice dinner together at their apartments which are only 2 minutes away from mine.

## Reserach
I continued working on my simulations regarding the relaxation of cuboids subjected to torsion.
I also did some mesh convergence tests to make sure that my results are not affected by the mesh size.
I am now confident that the results can be viewed as converged solutions, and we can start analyzing them in more detail.

## Training
I completed the swim workout planned for yesterday.
The pool was quite crowded today, so I had to wait a bit before starting and had to get out of the pool a little earlier than planned.

Baguettes are always getting better.
