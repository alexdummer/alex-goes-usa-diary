## Day summary
Today started my first weekend in Boulder. I woke up at approximately 5am so my jetlag is still here. After my breakfast I walked to the [Feet Fleet](https://www.fleetfeet.com) running store to buy new trail running shoes. I bought the Altra Timp 5 with additional insoles to increase stability. These shoes have zero drop which should help to mimic the natural barefoot stride. Additionally, I got a massage tool for tight muscles. In the afternoon I went for a short run staring from the western end of Baseline Rd to test the new shoes. Most of commuting was done by walking totalling 30.500 steps.

## Training & Sports
With new trail running shoes purchased it is clear that they have to be tested immediately. Hence, I did a trail run starting at Chautauqua Park. The uphill was quite steep - a little bit too steep for my current fitness level. At the top I was really exhausted and glad that I only had to get down again. The activity can be found on my [Strava](https://strava.app.link/KBGreyad1Wb) (6.3km, 267hm, 47min moving time)

## Food & Drinks
I had lunch at the large dining area at the University. For 11$ you can get an all you can eat buffet with lots of options to choose from. The food was very good and affordable. I will definitely be back.
