## Reserach
Because I had the appointment at the social security office yesterday, I had to reschedule my weekly meeting with my host professor to today.
In the morning I prepared some slides for the meeting.
In the meeting we discussed the progress of my simulations and some preliminary numerical results.
After that I joined the weekly meeting of the MatterAssembly group.

## Training
In the evening I went to the pool for swim training.
I focused on improving my freestyle technique.
