## Day summary
In the morning I met with Peter and Nasser to discuss the paper on preconditioner strategies for generalized continuum models. We made a good progress, and I think the can be submitted in near future.
After that, I went to CU Surplus to purchase a used desktop and monitor for my office. The prices are reasonable but the machines are not really at the high end. 
Went to the office and for a swim in the afternoon. I missed the bus to come home once again by one minute, so I had to walk back. 

## Research
I mostly prepared the slides for the meeting with my host tomorrow. 
Additionally, I got deeper into the laws of thermodynamics, the 
derivation of the power of internal forces, and the Clausius-Duhem inequality for micropolar continua. We would say "harter tobak"!

## Training
Today it was the first time I went to the swimming pool at the University for a swim. It is definitely very different to other endurance sports I am used to. 
For the first time I think it was okay, but I had to rest after every 100 yards. In total a swam 983 meters in approximately 24 minutes. I have no idea if that is slow or very slow.
