## Hike to South Arapahoe Peak
Today I had planned to make a small hike with Sebastian.
However, when we arrived at the 4th of July trailhead we decided to
hike the South Arapahoe Peak instead, which is over 4000 meters high!
This was my first time above 4000 meters, and I was excited to see how
my body would react to the altitude.
Of course, the hike was challenging, but the views from the summit
were absolutely breathtaking.
On the way up the trail was partially icy, so we had to be careful with
our footing.
The last part of the hike was a bit tricky, as we had to scramble over some
rocks to reach the summit.
It is classified as a class 2 hike, which means that some hands-on climbing
is required.
From the summit, we could see the entire Boulder area and beyond.
On the wa home we had pizza in Nederland, which was a perfect way to
end the day.
The pizza was a mixture of Italian and American style.
