## Day summary
I am still struggling with the jetlag. Maybe the altidude is also affecting the adaptations. I woke up again at 3am and couldn't sleep afterwards. However, getting up early today was planned since Paul defended his PhD at 5am (Mountain Time) where I attended virtually. Well done, congrats to your academic milestone Paul. After that I had a meeting with my Master's student in Innsbruck where we discussed the recent progress. I explored my neighboorhood with a short run and then went to find a bank for opening an account without a social security number. I made an appointment at Wells Fargo (if you know why I chose this bank you know). I also got a prepaid plan for my cell phone and an American number.

## University, Research, etc. 
I arrived at CU at about 2pm and started working in my shared office. i am together with two PhD students also working on computational mechanics. 
I also got some documentation stuff done for Marmot (https://github.com/MAteRialMOdelingToolbox/Marmot).  

## Training & Sports
In the morning I had time to go for a short 5km run exploring my immediate neighborhood (https://strava.app.link/E17mazHYYWb). It is really beautiful here. I felt good on the run, although I am feeling the altitude and the jetlag. Also my knee did not hurt.

## Food & Drinks
Nothing special here. Cooked pasta with vegetables in the evening.
