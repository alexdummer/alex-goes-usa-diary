## Day summary
I was sad that I could not attend the birthday party of my wife back in Austria in person.
However, Anna and Lukas made it possible that I was present on a tablet like Sheldon in Big Bang Theory. I also cracked a beer at 9 am ;)
After I was at the party virtually, I went for a hike. Back home I read a bit about the numerical library PETSc.

## Hiking
I started at Chautauqua Park through the Gregory Canyon up to the Green mountain. It was beautiful and sunny but quite cold at the top. I should have brought warmer clothes.
At the peak I met Sebastian. What a coincidence. He started in South Boulder for a trail run.
