## Day summary
Today, I visited the Social Security Adminstration office in Louisville to finish my application for a Social Security Number (SSN). 
The process was straightforward, and the staff were very helpful in guiding me through the necessary paperwork.
I had to provide several documents, including my passport, DS 2019 and I-94.
My social security number should arrive in the mail within the next two weeks.
I directly went to the university afterwards to continue my research.

## Reserach
I continued my work on the first simulations using the viscoelastic micropolar Neo Hooke model.
I used a torsional relaxation test to investigate the properties of the model.
The results look promising so far, and I plan to run more simulations to validate the findings.
I also looked at size effects in micropolar materials, which could have interesting implications for future studies.

## Training
In the morning I went for a short run spiced up with 3 x 75 lunges. 
Before that I warmed up with a few bodyweight exercises.
Lots of people were out running in the cool morning air.
