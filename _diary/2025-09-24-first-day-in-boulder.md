## 🌅 Morning

Woke up at 3am in the morning and couldn't sleep again afterwards. Feeling the jetlag. Heading of to Safeway groceries to get the first groceries at 7am. 

## 🔬 Research Update

No real research activities today as I'm still getting settled.

## 🏃‍♂️ Training & Sports

Took it easy today due to jet lag and altitude adjustment. Just a gentle walk around the neighborhood to explore and get my bearings. Planning to start with some light jogging once I've acclimatized.
