## First Morning in Boulder

Woke up at 3am in the morning and couldn't sleep again afterwards. Feeling the jetlag. I decided to  Safeway groceries to get the first groceries at 8am. Groceries seem to be rather expensive here. After coffee (french press) I attended the defense of a Master's student in Innsbruck 

## University, Research, etc.

In the afternoon I met my host professor at University of Colorado Boulder. He showed me around and gave me some options for my place to work for the next year. It is very different here to what I am used to. The research groups are spread over several floors and windows are obviously not necessary. I decided to start working in a shared office with two PhD students (no windows, but a large desk). My office may change during the time here. 

## Training & Sports

No training at all, but walked to the University from my apartment (~2mi). Boulder seems to be a beautiful place to be.

## Food & Drinks

For lunch I got a Buffalo Chicken Wrap at Bova's Market and Grill. Very good, but a little bit two spicy (may burn twice). My host invited me for dinner at Rincon Argentino near University.
