## Day summary
Two meetings in the morning, one with Lukas and one with Roberr from Innsbruck. I went to the University afterwards, and did a swm workout in the evening.
I also had time to cook a dinner and lunch for the next days at home.

## Research
I continued working on my microstructure generator. I managed to optimize the code a bit that it runs faster now. The current version is made for 2D , but i think it should be possible to extend it to 3D with some effort. I will try to do that in the next days.
I also conducted the first simulations with a very simple unit cell.
The first results show size effects as expected. I will compare the results to 
the micropolar model in the next days.

## Training
I did a swim workout in the evening.
Some intervals on the menu today; 6x100yd allout. 
The rest of the workout was dedicated endurance and technique work.
