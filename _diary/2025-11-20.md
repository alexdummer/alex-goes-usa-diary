I know I have been absent from the diary for a while. 
I was a bit lazy and also busy with other things.
But now I am back and ready to write again! I will try to be more consisnetnt and write at least a summary of my research and training activities every week.

## Research
I actually had too many things on my desk so I decidedto focus on drafting my first research paper here in Boulder.
For this I have to write the theory and run a lot of simulations.
This week I found a special kind of architectedt materials - chiral metamaterials. I learned about handedness and how they behave under load. They would be an interesting application for my research.

Today my host professor had a guest lecture in his finite element methods class.
I attended the lecture and learned about fitness for service for metallic equipment with cracks. It was interesting to see how finite elements and fracture mechanics can be combined to assess the safety of structures with defects.

## Training
Since my 8 hour hike 2 weeks I had a blister on my left heel and I could not run properly.
It is getting better and I will try to workout tomorrow again.
