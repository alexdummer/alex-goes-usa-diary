## Day summary
Not much to talk about. Went to the University and did a run in the evening that's it.

## Research
Worked on the implementation of a simple linear finite strain micropolar viscoelasticity model in [Marmot][marmot]. As always with implementing constitutive models, most of the time is spent on debugging and testing the code. I still have to further test the code tomoworrow and I have to implement a finite element as well. 

## Training
Another easy run on the menu today. 50 minutes at 136bpm heart rate. It was still slow but it is getting better. Stats: 7.2km, 50 min.
