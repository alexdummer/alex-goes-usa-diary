## Day summary
After breakfast i had a videocall with Anna, Lukas and Hannah. 
Fascinating how quickly the kids develop and change.
Then I catched the bus to come near to Chautauqua park, where I started my hike to the Flatirons.
I figured out that the poles which i bought at REI had not the samelength, 
so I had to go to REI to exchange them after the hike. That was no problem but a little detour.
In the evening I met Sebastian again. We went for a beer and then to the planetarium.
It was a great show (quite different to what I expected). I would say it was kind of esoteric, but relaxing.

## Training
Vietnamese soup with beef and noodles
I did a loop through the Chautauqua park to the Flatirons, and back. You can find a flyover of the hike [here](https://strava.app.link/3jNgpFifqXb).
I went up to about 2500m. Interestingly, there are still trees at that height.
The hike was about 19.5km and an ascent of 1250m. That took me a little over 4 hours.
It was a great hike with fantastic views. I made a lot of pictures, but I only show one here.
Mor e pictures can be found in my instagram story.
