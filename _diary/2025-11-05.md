## Research
I prepared some slides for my weekly meeting with my host.
We discussed the first microstructure simulations and the results look promising. 
We do see some size effects in the simple shear test with a very simple microstructure. 
That is something our micropolar model should be able to capture.
After the meeting I started to set up simulations for compression and tension tests.
I also rewrote most of the microstructure generator using numpy arrays where possible, instead of loops. The code is now significantly faster!
It is also easier to extend it to 3D microstructures.
