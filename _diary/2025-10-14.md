## Day summary
In the morning I met with Lukas and we discussed his recent progress in his Master's thesis. It is the time now for him to bring everything on the paper.
Afterwards I met with Peter to talk about my paper on the LGCDP model. We discussed his comments and I can now send it to the last internal review station. Hopefully, we can submit the paper by end of the week to Engineering Fracture Mechanics.
I had quite good progress in the office, and went for a indoor biking session in the evening.
Back home I had to refill my groceries. I also cooked rice and curry and made a dough for baguette again. A long exhausting day in Boulder.

## Research
In the office I fixed some bugs in my constitutive model and also implemented a finite element for the micropolar continuum. Luckily, I could reuse the implementation of Matthias, so it was kind of fast and straightforward. Thanks to Matthias for providing the code!
I also started to do first ssimple finite element simulations to test the model. The implementation now seems to work!

## Training
Today I nearly fell off the indoor bike. My plan said to do one hour at 195 watt. About a year ago this would have been endurance training. But not today. It actually felt like threshold training with my heart rate between 170 and 180 bpm. I could not hold the wattage throughout the hour. I hope it is getting normal again soon. Maybe I have to adapt the training zones.
