## Day summary
First time I really needed the wake up call in the morning.
I met with my Master student Matthias virtually for breakfast. We discussed the recent progress on his thesis 
and further steps to be taken. I introduced him to my tool for material parameter optimization with FE simulations [Buzzard](https://github.com/EdelweissFE/Buzzard).
We figured out that not everything was running smooth because I haven't had a look at his code for a while.
We then fixed all issues together and now everything is running fine.
I am looking forward to see the results in a few days.
I went to University by bus afterwards for my second offical day.
In the evening I missed the bus back home and had to walk about 30 minutes.

## University, Research, etc. 
Mainly worked on my derivation of the micropolar continuum model at finite strains 
incorporating time-dependent material behavior.
I am confident that I now have a theoretical prototype to discuss with 
my host at CU Boulder.
We will have to figure out which applications this model is suitable for.
In this reagard I am looking forward to the meeting with 
Prof. MacCurdy and his group tomorrow. The have a pretty nice [website](https://matterassembly.org/).
