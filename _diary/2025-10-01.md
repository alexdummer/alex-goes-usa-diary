## Day summary
I woke up at 6:30am, no jetlag anymore. Also, my cold is getting better. For breakfast I met Matthias virtually. We discussed my paper which should be ready for submission. Afterwards I headed to the University for my official program start of my Max Kade Fellowship at CU Boulder. My host and I set up a weekly meeting to discuss the progress. For lunch I had the last Mexican wraps. In the evening I cooked pasta (3 days pasta from now on ;))

## University, Research, etc. 
Another day diving into generalized continuum theories. I am learning to really appreciate Einstein's summation convention. Even high and low indices of tensor (indicating co and contravariant components) slowly start to make sense. Today, I got a concrete view how the model I want to develop can look like (at least in a simple linear form).
In addition, I worked on the paper (it is on concrete modeling) to get it ready for submission by the mid of October.
