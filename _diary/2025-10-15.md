## Day summary
I baked two baguettes again in the moring. They are getting really good. Afterwards a standard day: university, training, eat, sleep ;)

## Research
In the morning I prepared some slides for my weekly meeting with my supervisor. We discussed the recent progress and set a plan what to focus on in the next weeks. Also my desktop PC's RAM gets upgraded to 64GB. I will definitely need this, because the RAM ran full severel times when I tried to compile Tardigrade, a code co-developed at CU Boulder which I will use for upscaling direct numerical simulations. 
I struggled with configuring PETSc when building Ratel FEM. Hopefully I can figure out the problems in near future.  

## Training
A really hard training on the menu after yesterdays failure. 3 x 5 min at VO2Max heart rate. If you are aware of this zone you know how hard this feels. But interestingly I kind off enjoy this hard trainings. I felt better today and pushed my limits on the stepper. Summary: 45min and max heart rate 189bpm.
