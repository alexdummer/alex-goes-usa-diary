## Day summary
I woke up and baked a baguette myself.
After breakfast I talked to my parents in Austria on the phone.
At 11:30 Haden picked me up for lunch. I also met Alec, a friend of Haden. 
They play soccer together.
After lunch I went to the pool at CU for a long swim.
Back home I did some code reviews for [Marmot][marmot].

## Food
Haden asked me to come with him and his friend Alec to a Vietnamese restaurant in Erie. It is a 20 minute drive from Boulder. Haden used to live there in his first to years in the US. I had a delicious Pho soup with beef and noodles. It was really good, but it was a huge bowl.
Definitely a place to come back to.

## Training
Crazy stuff on the plan today.
Swim 5km in the pool. Luckily I did not drown ;). 
The long swim was quite exhausting and the fact that it is a 25 yard pool did not help.
I actually did somewhat like 4.8km because I was completely empty.
I am a little proud of myself that I managed to do it. Hopefully my coach is happy with it.
