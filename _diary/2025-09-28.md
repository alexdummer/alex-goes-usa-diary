## Day summary
I woke up today at 5:40am, which means that the jetlag affects my sleep less and less. This morning I watched the cycling World Championship road race. Once more, Tadej Pogacar demonstrated that he is the strongest caclist alive - Chapeau! 
My offices mates and I planned to play tennis today at the University recreation center. Unfortunately, Hooman got sick yesterday so there was only Haden and me left. I therefore headed to the University after my breakfast. I tried to go by bus, but was 1 minute to late at the station (this happend quite often the last days, I have to make friends with the bus drivers I guess). Because waiting for the next bus for one hour is way too long, I took the 35 minute walk to CU. I went to the Recreation center to get a semester pass which is really cheap for the offered infrastructure. When we tried to find a free tennis court I was surprised how big this sports center is. I think there is nothing you cannot do. There is even an ice rink. Unfortunately, there was no tennis court free, so we decided to go for lunch without sport before. We hang out afterwards at Haden's home.


## University, Research, etc. 
Back home I read some theory on the derivation of the micropolar continuum theory developed by Eringen and coworkers. I made a good progess in understanding the underlying kinematics.

## Food & Drinks
Haden took me to a Thai restaurant near Newton's court for lunch. I had fried rice which was really good, but not that cheap at all (20$).
