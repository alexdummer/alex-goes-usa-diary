## Day summary
Jetlag is getting better, woke up at 4:40am which is a 1,5 hour improvement compared to the last two days. After breakfast I went to my appointment at Wells Fargo and opened my US bank account. I walked to CU afterwards, where I got my semester bus pass through the university. It is pretty cheap with 95$ and you can ride all regional buses with it.

## University, Research, etc.
Today I was not really working on my research project, but I again spent time on [Marmot](https://github.com/MAteRialMOdelingToolbox/Marmot) documentation. I will try to finish most of the remaining tasks before I am officially starting my program on Oct 1.

## Training & Sports
All transportation today was by foot resulting in approximately 15k steps. In the evening a did a small strength and mobility workout.

## Food & Drinks
Had a vegan breakfast burrito from a small cafe in the Engineering center for lunch. I tried to finish my pasta from yesterday in the evening, but this didn't work out.
