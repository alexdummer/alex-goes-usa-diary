## Day summary
Wake up. Research. Run. Cook. Sleep. Kurz und knackig ;)

## Research
Today my host and I had our first productive meeting. I briefly presented my ideas for the micropolar viscoelastic model. We discussed the next steps together. I think we made a good progress and I will be able to show fisrt simulation results next week.
Worked again a bit on the documentation for [Marmot][marmot].

## Training
I the eveneing I went for a short run again. I could not say that I am feeling fit. Heart rate is 10-15bpm too high for the pace. Short summary: 4.75km and 32min moving time. 

## Photo of the day
Unfortunately no photo today.
