## Day summary
In the morining my wife and I went to downtown Boulder for breakfast.
We had a good time walking around Pearl Street and met with our friends at 
the University of Colorado campus.
I gave them a tour around the campus, showed them my office and we went 
for lunch to the on campus dining hall.
It was match day for the CU football team, so the campus was lively and full of energy.
After lunch, drove with them to the international airport for their flight back home.
It was a great day showing them around Boulder and spending time together.
In the evening, I met with my office mate Hooman for dinner and beers in the german Biergarten in downtown Boulder.
