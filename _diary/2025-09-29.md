## Day summary
The good thing about today was that I woke up at 6am and thus my jetlag is mostly gone. The bad thing is that I am having a cold now. Maybe the last days were to much for my body. Nothing really special to tell about the day. Had a virtual morning coffee with Peter reminding me of the times during the COVID crises where had lots of such meetings. The main difference is now that no cat is climbing over me. After that I went to the University preparing for my offical start on Wednesday.

## University, Research, etc. 
Spent the day with reading about kinematics of micropolar media. Getting more and more used to large deformations and the idea of micromorphic continnum theories. I also prepared to implement a linear finite strain viscoelastic model in [Marmot](https://github.com/MAteRialMOdelingToolbox/Marmot) to understand finite strain viscoelasticity. During this preparations I also did some more documentation for the finite strain module in Marmot.
