## Day summary
In the morning I had the weekly meeting with my Lukas from Innsbruck.
We discussed the recent progress. I am sure he is on the right track to finish his thesis in time.
Afterwards, I focused on coding all day. No training today, just pure coding.
I prepared some things for bringing our open source library [Marmot][marmot] to the next level.
