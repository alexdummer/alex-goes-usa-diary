## Day summary
As my cold is mostly gone I decided to do a hike to the Royal Arch today.
After the hike I went to downtown Boulder. There was a street festival and I grabbed 2 slices of pizza to fuel my body up again (I know, that's not the best to do but it tastes good).
After eating I walked to the REI store where I bought hiking/running poles
for my future trail running and hiking activities.
Since I want to go swimming at the recreation center at CU, I also got 
swim suits (yes, speedo like ;)), goggles and a pull buoy.
I still hope it is a good idea to go for a swim as an alternative training.

## Hiking
I went as near as I could get with the bus to the trailhead of Chautauqua park. This is still one mile away. So my hike started from the crossing Baseline Rd and Broadway. At the trailhead there was a whole bunch of people who decided to go for a hike on this beautiful day in fall. The leaves of the trees are very colorful. The hike up to the Royal Arch was good, however, I am still feeling that I was sick the last days. My heart rate was way too high for my climbing speed. But it felt really good to do some exercise again. The area is perfect for hiking and really beautiful. At the royal arch you have a really nice view over Boulder and the surrounding area. I met Jack who studies Civil Engineering at CU Boulder. A really nice guy who climbed the rocks of royal arch to get a better view. Bit to scary for me.
On the way down, I met a couple watching some rock climbers. During talking we figured out that he used to work in Graz. He said he loves the Alps. The world can be so small.
I decided to get down another way called the Flatiron loop.
Some stats of today: 9.16km distance, 137min moving time and 600m ascent.
