## Day summary
Wake up. Research. Run. Cook. Sleep. Again ;)

## Research
Today I got my desktop PC at the office. I spent some time to set it up and figured out that 8GB of RAM are not that much (I should have looked better when picking out ;)). I will talk to my host to get an upgrade here to 32GB.
I started programming in [Marmot][Marmot] and implemented a simple prototype for a hyperelastic micropolar model at finite strains. 
Every time I am surprised how automatic differentiation can make your life easier, especially in the development/prototyping phase.
I will test my implementation soon and then start with the viscoelastic model.

## Training
40 minutes at 136 bpm heart rate on the menu for today. I was really slow, but I felt good. No problems with my knee. I did 2 x 20 lunges for warm up and 2x 20 crunches and 2 x 20 superman swimmers after the run. Stats fo the day: 5.5km in 40 minutes. 

## Photo of the day
