## Day summary
At the University I had two scheduled meetings. The first one was with colleagues from
BOKU Vienna where we discussed modeling of strand based materials. We will adopt a model 
originally designed for wood and see how it performs.
The second meeting was the weekly group meeting of the [MatterAssembly][matterassembly] group at CU Boulder. Again it was very interesting what they are working on. We made a step towards collaboration by sharing some ideas. After work I went for a short swimming session to the recreation center.  

## Research
Today I looked up some potential candidates for Helmholtz free energy functions 
for modeling porous elastomeric structures. The behavior of these structures is mainly elastic, but cannot be described by a simple linear model. For example under compression cell walls or struts bend and then buckle, leading to significant changes in stiffness. At very large deformations one can see densification resulting in an stiffness increase again.
We will start off with the approach Abaqus uses and figure out how to extend it to the micropolar continuum.

## Training
Easy swim session today. Focused on my technique. I was in the water for about an hour and made 1600m.
