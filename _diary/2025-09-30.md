## Day summary
Not too much to report today. Still sick, so I cannot do something special.
I woke up early due to my cold, but it is getting slightly better.
At least my jetlag is gone now.
Hopefully I can start my outdoor activities again soon.
I still felt good enough to do some research at the University.

## University, Research, etc. 
I spent the day reading more about micropolar continuum theories. 
I am getting more and more used to the kinematics of such theories. 
Additionally, I implemented a simple Finite Strain Viscoelastic model in Marmot. 
It will be soon available in the main branch of Marmot.
By implementing this model I figured out how this approach may be also used
in the context of micropolar continua.
I also spent some time documenting the Finite Strain module of Marmot.
