## Day summary
I met with Lukas again in the morning for our weekly progress meeting.
His these is coming along nicely. I am confident that he can defend it before christmas.
I went to the office afterwards and went to the gym in the afternoon.

## Reserach
I mainly set up my simulations to be run on my workstation in Innsbruck. The preliminary results look like what I expected.
As every day I spent also some time reading and coding. 
In the evening I worked on the material point solver for the Marmot project.

## Training
I did a short bike session in the recreation center at the University. It was a good way to restart my training after a few days off.
I felt much better than in the previous sessions. 
Afterwards I did some strength training as well.
