## Day summary
I met with my Master's student in the morning for the weekly update. I figured out that this meeting holds him off from the weekly cake meeting in Innsbruck. We decided to meet everey Tuesday from now on ;). After that I walked to the University. I went to the gym for a training session in the evening. It is fascinating how well equipped this recreation center for students and affiates of CU Boulder is. See also te picture of the day.

## Research
I worked on the paper about preconditioner stategies for generalized continuum models in the morning. After that I prepared for the upcoming implementation of my first viscoelastic micropolar model.
I was invited to the weekly meeting of the [Matter Assembly][matterassembly] group. I struggeld a little bit with finding the room. The engineering center still feels like a labyrinth. In the meeting I learned about state of the art methods for 3D printed structures. It is exciting what is already possible. I hope we can work together and build up a collaboration.

## Training
Today I had an unconventional training on my plan. The first part focused on strength with 3 x 50 lunges. I also did some push ups and crunches. After that I spent 30 minutes on the cross trainer at 150 bpm heart rate.
