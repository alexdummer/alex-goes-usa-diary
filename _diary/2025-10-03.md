## Day summary
In the morning I met with Robert from the University of Innsbruck to discuss
a potential topic for a Master thesis in near future. We set up a plan for the next steps.
After that I decided to walk to the University. 30 minutes of walking in beautiful surroundings is not too bad (see the picture of the day). 

## Research
Most of the time I spent again on derivation and understanding micropolar kinematics.
At noon we had a meeting with Prof. MacCurdy and his group.
It was really inspiring to see how architected materials can look like nowadays.
I have also been invited to join their weekly team meetings. Hopefully, we can build up a strong collaboration.
Since dynamics may be play a role there I began to think about how to 
incorporate time integration and inertia terms in my formulation. 
They also have a lot of applications, e.g., impact mitigation, soft robotics and medical printing. You can have a look on their [website][matterassembly].
My host pointed out another group working on similar materials at ETH Zürich lead by Prof. Dennis Kochmann. For example they work on so-called truss metamaterials which can maybe described by micropolar theories. You can find more information [here][kochmann-trussmetamaterials].
In the afternoon, I began to review the pull requests for the documentation of our open source material and finite element library [Marmot][marmot].
