I made a short trip to Las Vegas from Friday to Monday to meet my wife and some friends there.



## Friday - Arrival in Las Vegas, meet family and friends
I prepared everything on Friday morning for my flight from Denver to Las Vegas in the evening.
I already met Stephan at the airport in Denver and we flew together to Vegas.
In Vegas we met my wife and some friends. After checking in at the hotel we went to the Hotel casino for some drinks.

## Saturday - Valley of Fire State Park, Limo ride and casino night
On Saturday morning we drove to the Valley of Fire State Park which is about an hour away from Las Vegas.
The park is known for its stunning red sandstone formations and ancient petroglyphs.
We did a small hike there and went back to Las Vegas in the afternoon.
In the evening we had a limo ride which was part of my present for my wifes birthday.
We had a great time cruising through the Las Vegas strip in the limo.
Afterwards we went to a casino for some gambling and drinks.

## Sunday - Death Valley National Park
On Sunday we drove to the Death Valley National Park which is about two hours away from Las Vegas.
Death Valley is known for its extreme temperatures and unique landscapes. But it was not too hot when we were there.
We wanted to visit Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, but the road was closed due to maintenance work.
Instead we explored some other parts of the park, including Zabriskie Point.
We took lots of pictures and enjoyed the unique scenery.
In the evening we went back to Las Vegas and had dinner at a crazy themed restaurant.

## Monday - Flight back to Denver
My flight back to Denver was scheduled for Monday 7am.
Stephan and my wife drove me to the airport early in the morning.
I said goodbye to them and boarded my flight back to Denver.
I will meet them again in Boulder later this week. They will drive there from Vegas.
My flight was delayed but I arrived safely in Denver and took a shuttle to Boulder.
I did some work at home.
