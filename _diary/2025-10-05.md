## Day summary
In the morning I did some reviews on code pull requests in [Marmot][marmot].
After that I went to the University to meet with Hooman an Haden for tennis.
We are all beginners, lost a few balls to the roof nearby, but had also a lot of fun.
In the afternoon I met with Sebastian (a PhD student in aerospace engineering with German parents and US passport) for a beer at Avanti in downtown Boulder.
It is a funny story how we had connected. I actually met a friend of him (an Austrian living in Montreal) at a wedding, and he said I could reach out to Sebastian if I have any questions regarding Boulder. We had a good conversation about university relasted stuff and outdoor activities.
He showed me around in downtown and gave me a ride back home. He actually lives quite near to my place.
