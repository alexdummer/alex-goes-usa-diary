# About This Diary üèîÔ∏è

Welcome to my personal diary documenting my incredible 1-year research stay in Boulder, Colorado! This is my digital journal where I share daily experiences, research adventures, outdoor activities, and everything that makes life in the beautiful Rocky Mountains so special.

## Why This Diary?

I wanted to create a meaningful record of this transformative year abroad. Boulder offers such a unique combination of world-class research opportunities and outdoor adventures that I felt compelled to document every aspect of this journey.

## The Technical Setup

This diary is built with:
- **Jekyll** - Static site generator
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting and automatic deployment
- **Markdown** - Simple, beautiful writing format
- **Tag System** - Easy organization and discovery
- **Responsive Design** - Looks great on any device

## Tags & Organization

I use a tagging system to organize entries by theme:
- `food` - Food and drinks 
- `research` - Academic and lab activities
- `training` - Sports, hiking, skiing, etc.
- `activities` - Social events and exploration
- `boulder` - Boulder-specific experiences
